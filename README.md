A Raspberry Pi Pico clone with a USB-C port.

It's _\[current year\]_. Micro-USB is old news. But board designers are, for
some reason, still using it. I dunno, it might be a little cheaper/simpler.
Maybe you don't _technically_ need USB-C anway if you're not using USB 3.0.
But, in my experience, USB-C is just so much better; there is hardly any
reason to not use it.
